if the length of the message isequal to one, this is a special edge case. to order to fix this, we are going just to makesure the length of the message is two, and the second byte is equal to 0x8c (any message of size one is invalid, so this is fix we have to do).
assuming this is not the case, we are going to put zero in the first byte of the message, and 0x8c in the second byte. 
if the first byte is zero- the program will xor nothing to 0x8c, and the will make sure this "xor result" is equal to the second byte, and will return 1 iff this is the case. so, our program is making sure this is the case, by putting 0x8c in the second byte and zero in the first byte.
